Hello, My name is Sujoy. I'm currently a grade 11 student in highschool. I'm relatively new to programming and coding
but, I hope to become more as time goes on and I gain more experience. Currently, I know how to code using Python 3,
C and Turing. I have some experience with Vex Robotics and game developement. Currently, I am interested in learning
about neural networks, robotics, A.I and Game Design. I hope to go into the game or robotics industry in the future.
